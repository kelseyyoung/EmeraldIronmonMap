## Using the map

Trainer information is available on hover, showing the number of pokemon they have, the levels of their pokemon, and any movement information. Trainers can be "marked" by clicking on them

Map "portals", like cave entrances and ladders, are clickable too! They will move the map to where it connects

You can highlight all map portals via the Control Panel with various display options
